    "* A library is a collection of packages or modules that are grouped together to extend functionality\n",
    "* Types:\n",
    "  1. Standard libraries (included with Python)\n",
    "  2. Third-party libraries & packages (need to be installed)\n",
    "* Typically, installed using package managers like pip or conda\n",

    "### What the heck are Packages then?\n",
    "- A package can include modules and sub-packages \n",

    "### Packages vs Libraries\n",
    "- Python uses packages to organize inside it's libraries, and libraries to provide and extend functionalities.   \n",
    "- While **all libraries can be considered packages** (if they are structured that way), **not all packages are libraries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance \n",
    "* It helps save time, standardize processes, and add complex functionalities easily.\n",

    "- `open`: Opens a file. The 'r' mode is for reading, 'w' for writing (overwrites content), 'a' for appending, and 'b' for binary mode.\n",
    "- `read`: Reads the content of an opened file. Can also use `readline()` for a single line or `readlines()` for all lines as a list.\n",
    "- `write`: Writes a string to an opened file. If the file is opened in append mode ('a'), the text is added at the end.\n",
